# README for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction
This is the repository of script and code book for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Course Project

## The Script
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## The Code Book
The Code Book, `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and transformation to clean up the data 

## The Result
The end result is shown in the file `tidydata.txt`.
